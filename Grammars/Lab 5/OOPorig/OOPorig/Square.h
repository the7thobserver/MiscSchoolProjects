// Contains the declaration (but not the definition) of the Square class.
// Square inherits from Rectangle; what sets Squares apart from Rectangles
// is that their width and height must be equal at all times.  (This doesn't
// turn out to be a very good use of inheritance; it's generally a bad idea
// for a subclass to be more restricted than its superclass.  I included this
// class primarily because I wanted to have a simple example of an inheritance
// hierarchy with three levels.)
