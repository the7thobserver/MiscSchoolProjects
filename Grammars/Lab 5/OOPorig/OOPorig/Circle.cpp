// Just like in Java, the first thing a constructor of a derived class
// does is call the constructor of its base class.  This syntax:
//
//     : Shape(positionX, positionY)
//
// ...is how you write that in C++.  This says that the first thing
// that the Circle constructor should do is call the Shape constructor,
// passing positionX and positionY as parameters.

	// could declare it globally, or as a field of the Circle class.
