// example (OOPorig), except that they have an additional parameter
// called _this, which represents the object that they're being
// called on.


// This is the same constructor.  Note that it's not the constructor's
// job to allocate memory for an object; the constructor's job is to
// take an object that's already been allocated and initialize it,
// which is why you don't see the use of the "new" operator or a call
// to malloc() here.
//
// Remember that, since Shape is abstract, there's no way to create
// Shape objects.  But you still need a Shape constructor, since the
// constructor's of Shape's derived classes (e.g. Circle) will need
// to call it.
